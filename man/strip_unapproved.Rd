\description{
\code{strip_unapproved} is an internal function which essentially 'deletes' layers 
from the current ternary plot in the event that such layers are not one of the 
approved layers. For a layer to be approved, it must use an approved geometry, and also an approved stat. 
Refer to \link{approved_layers} for the current list of approved geometries and stats
